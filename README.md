This repository only contains the files that I created myself. In creating this program, I used the work of two other people: 
RtMidi by Dr. Gary Scavone which can be found here:https://github.com/thestk/rtmidi
as well as WriteMidi by github user Craigsapp which can be found here: https://github.com/craigsapp/midifile

This program implements a Euclidean Rhythm Generator. To learn more about it, please read the following Medium page:
